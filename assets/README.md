# Assets Folder

This folder contains resources for the Egg Timer app.

## Required Files

### icon.png
- App icon (recommended size: 512x512 pixels)
- You can create one using:
  - Online tools like Canva or Figma
  - Use an egg emoji screenshot
  - Download a free icon from icons8.com or flaticon.com

### alarm.mp3 (optional)
- Sound that plays when timer completes
- If not provided, the app will generate a beep sound
- You can use any short MP3 sound file

## Quick Setup

If you don't have these files yet:

1. **For icon.png**: 
   - Take a screenshot of the 🥚 emoji
   - Save it as `icon.png` in this folder
   - Or use any egg/timer image you like

2. **For alarm.mp3**:
   - Find a free alarm sound online
   - Save it as `alarm.mp3` in this folder
   - Or skip it - the app will still work!

The app will work even without these files, but adding them makes it more polished.
